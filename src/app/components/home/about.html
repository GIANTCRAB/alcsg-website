        <p>We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere. We act as a catalyst for leaders by providing them a platform
          to start up volunteer events for social causes they believe in. Weâ€™re big believers in doing right by our
          neighbors. So we do what we can to support the community we love.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Our vision is to allow every volunteer to have an opportunity to make a little change. We also believe that the
          little change contributed by these volunteers can make a big difference. Our mission is to provide a platform
          which integrates all volunteers and provide them with the resources that can aid them in volunteering.</p>
